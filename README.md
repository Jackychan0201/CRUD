## Installation and testing the app locally
Here are the steps for local testing of the application:
- Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jackychan0201/CRUD.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd CRUD
```
- Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```
- Set the environment variable:
    - create a .env file inside the backend directory:
